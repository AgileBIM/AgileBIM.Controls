# AgileBIM.Controls
This is a project that was created to consolidate the random controls I have to make because WPF didn't natively provide them or at least not to the degree I needed them. Your welcome to use them for whatever purpose you want.

### Available Controls

- WatermarkTextBox
- ColorPicker (windows brushes)
