# AgileBIM.Controls
This is a project that was created to consolidate the random controls I have to make because WPF didn't natively provide them or at least not to the degree I needed them. Your welcome to use them for whatever purpose you want.

### Available Controls

- WatermarkTextBox
  - Watermark is the ghost text property
  - Includes a BorderRadius property
- ColorPicker 
  - Based on windows brushes
  - Uses a popup for the selector
  - SelectedColor is the the current color
  - Includes a BorderRadius property, this has an effect on the popup buttons too
